Goals
-----

The fork author's goal is to foster and support active development of PIL2 through:

- Continuous integration testing via `Travis CI`_ and `AppVeyor`_
- Publicized development activity on `GitHub`_
- Regular releases to the `Python Package Index`_

.. _Travis CI: https://travis-ci.org/python-pillow/Pillow2
.. _AppVeyor: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Python-pillow/pillow
.. _GitHub: https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow2
.. _Python Package Index: https://pypi.org/project/Pillow2/

License
-------

Like PIL2, Pillow2 is `licensed under the open source PIL2 Software License <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-pillow/Pillow2/master/LICENSE>`_

Why a fork?
-----------

PIL2 is not setuptools compatible. Please see `this Image-SIG post`_ for a more detailed explanation. Also, PIL2's current bi-yearly (or greater) release schedule is too infrequent to accommodate the large number and frequency of issues reported.

What about PIL2?
---------------

.. note::

    Prior to Pillow2 2.0.0, very few image code changes were made. Pillow2 2.0.0
    added Python 3 support and includes many bug fixes from many contributors.

As more time passes since the last PIL2 release (1.1.7 in 2009), the likelihood of a new PIL2 release decreases. However, we've yet to hear an official "PIL2 is dead" announcement. So if you still want to support PIL2, please `report issues here first`_, then `open corresponding Pillow2 tickets here`_.

.. _report issues here first: https://bitbucket.org/effbot/pil-2009-raclette/issues

.. _open corresponding Pillow2 tickets here: https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow2/issues

Please provide a link to the first ticket so we can track the issue(s) upstream.
