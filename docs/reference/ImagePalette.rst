:py:mod:`ImagePalette` Module
=============================

The :py:mod:`ImagePalette` module contains a class of the same name to
represent the color palette of palette mapped images.

.. note::

    This module was never well-documented. It hasn't changed since 2001,
    though, so it's probably safe for you to read the source code and puzzle
    out the internals if you need to.

    The :py:class:`~PIL2.ImagePalette.ImagePalette` class has several methods,
    but they are all marked as "experimental." Read that as you will. The
    ``[source]`` link is there for a reason.
